-- The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

-- The UNION operator automatically removes duplicate rows from the result set.

-- Requirements for UNION: 
    -- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
    -- The columns must also have similar data types
    -- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
