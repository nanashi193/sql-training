-- Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
);

-- The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

NOT NULL -- Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE -- Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY -- A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY -- Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK -- Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT -- Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX -- Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
